# Contributing
The BetteRoads project would involves a healthy amount of open
discussions between the core development team and the community.

BetteRoads operates similar to most open source projects on GitHub.
However, if you've never contributed to an open source project before,
here is the basic process, but i would suggest you to wath this [video](https://github.com/manish-sin/BetteRoads/issues) first it gives video gives very intresting introduction for the first time contributors

-  **Figure out what you're going to work on.** The majority of open
   source contributions come from people scratching their own itches.
   However, if you don't know what you want to work on, or are just
   looking to get more acquainted with the project, here are some tips
   for how to find appropriate tasks:

   -  Look through the `[issue tracker](https://github.com/manish-sin/BetteRoads/issues) and see if there are any issues you know how to fix. Issues that are confirmed by other contributors tend to be better to investigate. We also maintain some labels for issues which are likely to be
good for new people, e.g. good first issue.
	- If you are the kind of person who likes to start a project from begning rather resolving the issue. The the [project tracker](https://github.com/manish-sin/BetteRoads/projects) is the place you are looking for. This video Explains the ideas to work upon. If you are intrested in any of the these projects, please fill in the details in here, so that we can contact as soon as we we have sufficent resource.
   -  If you wish to add more features or projects please drop us a mail on contact contact@betteroads.net. You may reach us for any outher querry on the same mail id. We willtry our best to reply ASAP, but no more than 24 hours.
   - As the community grows we will start communicating on a slack group, till than we will communicate via this mail

-  **Figure out the scope of your change and reach out for design
   comments on a GitHub issue if it's large.** The majority of pull
   requests are small; in that case, no need to let us know about what
   you want to do, just get cracking. But if the change is going to be
   large, it's usually a good idea to get some design comments about it
   first.
	  - In Case you wish to make major changes, please go through these [blogs](http://xplorml.in/?p=24), it explains the complete development of project till the first commit. I am yet to add the method of trainig the model, will share the its link here soon

   - If you don't know how big a change is going to be, we can help you
      figure it out! Just drop us a mail

   - If you are not ready for the pull request to be reviewed, tag it with [WIP]. We will ignore it when doing review passes. If you are working on a complex 	change, it's good to start things off as WIP.
