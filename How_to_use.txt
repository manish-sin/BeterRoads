This file explains how to use this project to plot a map from a video

Note: As of current state of projects, Maps can ve ploted for only one video, In future we will develop ,
how to process multiple video and map them into single map

Step 1: Place your video in the folder %road_survey_vid/upload_folder. Name the vido files as gpscams.mp4, else erro may occur in step 6. If you dont have a video we have already placed a small sample video, you can Skip this step.
Note 1: As of now the video should be taken in this(check this http://xplorml.in/?p=29) specific way.
When Android app is developed taking video will be much simpler

Step 2: Run the setup.py

Step 3: Run the Vid_to_frame.py

Step 4: Locate the coordinates for croping (latitude (line no 42), Longtude(line no 46), Image(line no 47)) and change the value in coordinate_extraction.py and then run it.
In order to find coordinates for croping open any of the frames in %frame folder in MS paintmove the cursor n the frame to get coordinate. In order to get an idea of how much area of image should be cropped\
check these image in ROOT_DIR(LAT.jpg, LONG.jpg, img.jpg)
Note 1: Replacing the coordinate is required beacuse of different aspect ratio of phone and this needs to be done only once for a phone
Note 2: Here we can run change the value of how many frames do we wish to keep for processing.
To do this change the value of variable named "extract_fps"
Note 3: Once this coordinate_extraction.py is executed check no. of images in %road_images folder   folder much much higher than %wrong_coordinate_extraction else it would meand coodinate extraction is not happeig properly, You could also check long.jpg, lat.jpg image at regular frequency while this progrm is being executed
Note 4: If you are using the default video in this repository you dont need to check coordinates, simply execute coordinae_extraction.py

Step 5: Run the demo.py file

Step 6: Run the post_processing.py

Step 7: Run the maper.py file

Step 8: pothole_map.html is output file which will show the map

Step 9: Images stored in the %pot_holes_detected folder will be refer when the red circle are clicked
